I'm a greased up killer with a cool kick start
(With a kick, kick, cool kick start)
I'm a ton up tiger, you're a teenage tart
(I'm a teenage, teenage tart)

My pipes are rusty and my brakes are worn
Baby, I think I'm gonna say so long

I'm a burned out bugger with a rotting gut
(With a rotting, rotting gut)
Gonna rip that rubber in a raging rut
(In a raging, raging rut)

My zips are rusty and my drip's run dry
Baby, I think I'm gonna say bye-bye

I'm a right rank rocker with a rabid riff
(With a rabid, rabid riff)
Gonna hang that Harley and a-cut my quiff)
(With a snip, snip, cut his quiff)

My big end's busting and my pump is gone
Baby, I think I'm gonna say so long
